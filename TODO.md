### TODO

- [ ] Improve metadata reading functionality
- [ ] Add metadata writing

- This will only be a simple peak detection to find [bad messages](https://www.opensourceinstruments.com/Electronics/A3017/SCT.html#Bad%20Messages)
- [ ] Improve the documentation

### Notes
I currently do not have access to a MATLAB license. If anyone indicates interest I will see what I can do about implementing the additional funcitons.
